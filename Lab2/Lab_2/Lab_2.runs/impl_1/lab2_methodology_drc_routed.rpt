Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock datapath/audio_codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin datapath/audio_codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch control/cw_reg[2]/L7 (in control/cw_reg[2] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin control/cw_reg[2]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on reset_n overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
