TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): button_activity_reg[3]/C, button_activity_reg[2]/C, button_activity_reg[4]/C, button_activity_reg[1]/C, button_activity_reg[0]/C, old_button_reg[2]/C, old_button_reg[0]/C, old_button_reg[1]/C, old_button_reg[3]/C, old_button_reg[4]/C, trigger_time_reg[1]/C, trigger_time_reg[2]/C, trigger_time_reg[3]/C, trigger_time_reg[7]/C, trigger_time_reg[9]/C (the first 15 of 30 listed)
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on reset_n overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
